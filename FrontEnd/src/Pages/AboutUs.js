   this innovative way of buying products satisfactorily by roaming around the store and viewing products that are

    The metaverse is an immersive virtual world where people can meet, chat and collaborate as if they were 
in the same room. In contrast, traditional virtual worlds are generally unrealistic and unengaging, and 
the people who meet there do not look very human.
Virtual tours are interactive online 360° x 180° panoramic 3D images that simulate a location. 
They represent a real location in virtual reality. They do not video that limit what a viewer can see, but are 360°
 image based that are interactive. They give the viewer a choice in what to look at in the given location in high 
 definition and the freedom to move around the location as they choose.
 The freedom to interact makes the tour a realistic and engaging marketing tool.
